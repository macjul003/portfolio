description: Why I decided to share my process, not just the polished outcomes.

There's a certain comfort in only showing finished work. You control the narrative — every pixel considered, every decision justified. But I've started to think that comfort is a trap.

## The polished portfolio problem

Most design portfolios are museums. Beautiful, curated, and completely static. They show *what* was made but rarely *how* or *why*. The messy middle — the dead ends, the trade-offs, the moments of genuine confusion — gets edited out.

I've been guilty of this. My portfolio has always been a highlight reel. But highlights don't teach, and they don't connect.

## What changes

This journal is an experiment in working with the garage door open. I'll write about:

- **Design decisions** — the reasoning behind choices, not just the outcomes
- **Tools and process** — what I actually use day-to-day and why
- **Things I got wrong** — because that's where the interesting lessons live

## Why now

I've spent enough time consuming other people's thinking. It's time to contribute my own — even when it's half-formed, even when I might be wrong.
